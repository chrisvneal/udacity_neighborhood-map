# Neighborhood Map w/ React Project - Udacity FEND

This Neighborhood Map was built using the React.js UI library and is the final project of the Udacity Front End Nanodegree program. The map was built using the [Google API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial) and used data from [Foursquare's API.](https://developer.foursquare.com/docs)




## Using the Foursquare and Google Maps APIs
As the page loads, markers are plotted on a map detailing venues in the area of Waiki, Hawaii. The Foursquare API provides this data and the Google API helps plot the markers and other locations.


This app will especially help visitors to the Island who are in search of the hottest food spots in Waikiki. Type in the name of your favorite restaurant and it just might pop out - the closest locations will be plotted along the map.
